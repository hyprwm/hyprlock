        Anything that can help. Please always ATTACH and not paste them.
        To get hyprlock logs, start it from the commandline.
        If you are using hypridle/swayidle as a systemd service, you can use `journalctl -b0 --user -u hypridle/swayidle` to get some logs.
        Compositor logs and crashes are sometimes relevant as well.
        Hyprland logs can be found in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr.
        Hyprland crash reports are stored in ~/.cache/hyprland or $XDG_CACHE_HOME/hyprland.
